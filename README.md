## About RoboClick ##

RoboClick is an auto-clicking app that sits in your Mac OS X menubar so it
doesn't get in the way of your gaming experience.

I developed it to help my nephew play Minecraft and also to familiarize myself
with Cocoa, Xcode, and Obj-C.  It doesn't follow the MVC design pattern and most
of the code is stuffed into the AppDelegate.

## Features ##

- Repeat a left or right click up to 25 times per second.
- Hold a left or right click.
- Repeat and hold click actions are controlled by configurable hotkeys for fast execution.
- Reduce out of control auto-clicking by enabling RoboClick to stay inside one
  application by pid (process ID).
- Sits in your menubar
- Click indicators to see where you're clicking (optional)
